# Welcome to Docs for the Documentation
It might seem a little odd to have a documentation page for the documentation itself, but it's actually quite useful
because that way other team members can more easily document their own code. Here you'll find the basic system used for the documentation
as well as the customizations made to the default theme.

## The stack
This documentation uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is a framework for building static documentation websites.
It's based on [React](https://reactjs.org/). Here it's used in combination with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Used Features

### Native features
Docusaurus ships with a lot of features out of the box, so here's a list of the features that are enabled for this documentation site:
- Localisation using [i18n](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction)
- Docs-only mode (see [docs-only mode](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction#docs-only-mode))
- Use with TypeScript (see [TypeScript](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support))

### Custom features
Here you can find a list of the features that are enabled for this documentation site, but that aren't natively supported by Docusaurus:
- Use with TailwindCSS (see [Docusaurus with TailwindCSS](https://dev.to/sajclarke_62/using-tailwindcss-v3-in-docusaurus-in-5-steps-5c26))

## Customizations to the default theme
The Docusaurus theme is fantastic, still it's not perfect. Here you can find some customizations that were made to the default theme:
- The color theme was modified to use #154194 as the primary color
- The default font was changed to [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- The link to GitHub was modified to only display the icon
- The footer was customized to match the one on the [MINTvernetzt Website](https://www.mint-vernetzt.de/)
